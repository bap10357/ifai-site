I took a few photos a while ago that I thought looked nice. They were on the blog in a separate post, but I thought that I should recompile them and put them back with a nicer gallery type setup so that you could just click on them to view.

I also took the opportunity while doing some of this maintenance on my site to change the theme. The new one is called “BlogBD”, and it looks pretty nice, except that I was struggling with trying to apply a header image and had to settle for a solid color that looked okay. Hopefully this site isn’t terribly ugly—my taste in Web design is something approximate to whatever it is they have in Japan, I think. It’s a vibe, for sure.

Here are the photos!
