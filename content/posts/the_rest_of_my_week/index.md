I went searching the Internet for Mandopop out of interest & now I can't get the cheesy KTV songs out of my head...

Otherwise, though, it's been a great week so far. I've definitely been tired, and the weather's been so nice that my seasonal allergies are back (disappointing) and I'm back to taking allergy medication (usually, this climaxes in a bout of migraines every few days for a number of weeks during the summer, my least favorite seasonal pattern).

This is my schedule for the rest of the week —

 - Clarinet lesson (fun)
 - Gen-ed music class (also pretty fun, basically like high school. I was supposed to take this my first semester...)
 - IC Tech lab (fun, but I'm always exhausted & it's three hours long. Maybe today I'll have some caffeine beforehand.)
 - Concert band rehearsal (very fun. You know, maybe Thursday's just a good day of the week).

Then, on Friday, I have

 - IC Tech lecture (probably will be interesting, I don't know, it's at 9 AM so it's after my morning energy burst but before I have my daily momentum going.)
 - That class where we do study abroad things (it's getting pretty good right now because we have the contact info of our study abroad partners & I'm going to get to meet them for the first time soon.)
 - Mandarin class (except it's going to be online & the second half of our lesson 3 test is asynchronous. 不行......)
 - Chinese Conversation Table (the favorite student organization of me & everyone I know. Never a single asynchronous assignment!)

Then I can drive home.

And meet this cool new puppy my parents got. He's pretty cute —

I don't have much else to say, honestly, but I'm surprised with how well I'm holding it all together this week so far considering that it's a week before break (usually, those are pretty bad & everyone's exhausted). Career fair was yesterday, and I handed out five physical resumes. A few of them even got marked up a little bit. Hopefully one of them goes somewhere — I won't keep my hopes up, though.

This week, every day, for breakfast, I've been making drip coffee into instant oatmeal. Just mentioning it because it's pretty good & I've never heard of anyone else doing it. You should try it. It's sugar, caffeine, and carbs all in one mug.

下個星期我回來。

那時候見！
