...do you get the pun? I'm in that kind of mood today. Please enjoy.

I was feeling a little limited by the paid aspect of my old WordPress presence. It's nice software, but I'm not super patient with the block editor and I can get more customizability using a static site generator. I still keep my domains registered at WordPress and I might create another site there some other day.

Hugo, the static site generator that I use now (and used to use) is easy to set up, it builds sites quickly and it's completely free and open-source. WordPress is free and open-source too, but I had been using WordPress.com hosting, which isn't free if you want some of the features that I had been using (attaching a domain name, using the twenty-twelve theme...). I have much more freedom in Hugo, and I can use whichever hosting I want. This doesn't even require PHP, which is extremely nice and makes for a lot of flexibility.

I haven't attached a Disqus account or any kind of other mechanism for commenting because the comments on my old blog weren't being used too frequently (and not by anyone who I didn't already know â€” I guess we can just text).

I've also added my resume to the site, mostly to provide links to some of my projects and reports for easy access.

Thank you for the support and the patience! I really do appreciate it.
