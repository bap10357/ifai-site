I might be off of it a little bit.

<!--more-->

Lately, I know I've been dumping a lot of my weekend and nighttime thought processes into my keyboard and publishing it here. I think that that doesn't generate work of the highest quality — if I wouldn't do my homework at a particular time, maybe I shouldn't be writing either. Or, at least, I should do more than ramble (although controlled rambling is a proven-effective form of therapy, right?).

The picture up above is another really nice Wikimedia Commons photo of Mount Petros in Ukraine (eastern Europe is pretty beautiful on the whole, I think). The author is Михайло Пецкович, Львів — I don't know how to read Cyrillic, but it's good work, right? I'm sure if you copy & paste and look up that name, you'll find more work and the person behind it.

I need to come across a little more level-headed.

So, I've found another Hugo theme that I think is a little cleaner than the old one, I've updated my profile picture and I've removed my resume from the site here (the one on this page was a little out-of-date anyway).

At the time of writing right now, I'm sitting in my bed on a Saturday morning waiting for my clothes to finish drying. The weather is supposed to be horrible today, but I'm meeting with some people on-campus later. All I can hope is that the busses are running — I don't think I want to walk in any of those several inches of snow we're supposed to get across today and tomorrow. I'm here cleaning up my blog and trying to project a more level-headed Internet being now that I have sleep (I think this is the inflection point where my semester starts to get better again after the bottoming-out of flu season and weeks three and four).

I've got another exam this coming Monday, so I should probably be prepared for that, and then I've got a little presentation project for a small gen-ed that I had to take — I was supposed to take it my first semester, but I missed out on that — at least there's a new professor teaching it now, and he's pretty cool. The old one was good — this is a music gen-ed and I'd already had him for concert band — but I think the old one had a very low opinion of me (as anyone who met me as a freshman probably would have) and I'm trying to project myself a little better with the new one. So far, I'm doing about fifty percent okay.

All this is to say that I have some work to do this weekend, but I think I can take it at a reasonable pace, and only recently have I really discovered the wonders of getting rest on the weekend — it's actually more helpful than you'd think.

I'm currently in the midst of a several days-long process of bugging some representatives of a hiring team for a potential internship employer that I'm trying to corner before the career fair comes at the beginning of next month. So far, they came to my IC Technology lab, where they saw and — hopefully — appreciated my nice and efficiently-implemented XOR gate, good-looking resistor where I shaped the doped region to look like a resistance circuit symbol, and a transistor (somebody can find a use for all these three things on one chip, I'm sure), then they held an info session that I sat at for 90 or so minutes.

The day after, they came to my IC Technology lecture in the morning, where I made sure to sit close, make plenty of eye contact, and ask good questions, and then they showed up on the first floor of the engineering building, so I made sure to get in line and make sure they left with a copy of my resume and transcript. I sincerely hope they're sensing my enthusiasm.

I need to get myself an internship — I'm also currently trying to 得到我已经很想做的中文专业 get myself a double major in "applied Mandarin" and find myself a study abroad time & location — but other than that, I'm trying to get rest and eat food that makes me feel like a living organism instead of a malnourished lump.

可能我应该在这个网站写更多中文句子。我一定需要练习，再说我刚才发现我有的时候会说中文的比以前好。好像我真学到很多！我以为了这不会发生。

谢谢你们看！

Thank you for putting up with my acceptable writing, "controlled rambling", and questionable Mandarin.

I'll be back soon!
