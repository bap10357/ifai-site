As anyone who knows my blog can tell, I’ve moved. Again!

<!--more-->

This is a bad habit of mine, but experimenting with technology is the only way to learn, right? Self-hosting and renting all that rackspace was getting very expensive, and I didn’t really want to deal with it anymore — I’m now on wordpress.com, and with a new domain to boot.

I’ve also (as you can see in the featured image) added a nice rug to my bedroom. It adds some very nice flair. In case you’re wondering, the water-bottle shower curtain rings didn’t last — I sucked it up and spent the $8 at Target to get some regular metal ones (nickel, I think).

This is another short post, since I’m a little tired and the semester is getting into me once again (not a bad thing, though! It’s exhilarating). I should go on a little bit of a walk and then start grinding like a true grindset student (fill in the blogger’s equivalent of a /s here).

Anyway, WordPress proper seems to have some generative AI features that creep me out a little bit right now. If I ever feel like a masochist, you’ll know. It even seems to be able to generate pictures…

And I’ve switched from elementary OS to vanilla OS, then back to the good standard Fedora 40. Distro-hopping is one old habit that’ll die hard.

Thanks for sticking through the (short and sudden) transition!
