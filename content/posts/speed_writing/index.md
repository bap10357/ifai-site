This is what I'm doing today — I've got 20 minutes until my first class starts...

...but the blogging impulse came on & I think the thumbnail image from my post this past weekend isn't super aesthetically-pleasing to have on the front page of my website. I want to make this page nice-looking and nice to read!

As far as plans from the recent past goes, I've made progress

 - Beginning the discussion about a summer research internship
 - Two emails further into the double major application process
 - I've got my housing decided & it's with people that I know (with one spot free to be filled by a stranger — we still have yet to find out who)

I also did some theming on my laptop & I have it looking pretty nice — nice enough to be worth sharing. If you have a Mac and you've never enabled the "Silver Aerogel" theme, it looks pretty cool.

I steel feel a little bit of a strange combination of on top of my assignments & a behind, because of the number of liberal arts classes I'm taking this semester while simultaneously being an engineering major — I'm just trying to get caught up and finish my gen-eds, but it's made for a strange schedule for the time being. Not to say I don't enjoy it — I have a rehearsal, sectionals, and a concert all back-to-back this afternoon. That'll be cool!

I still have an engineering-related class to go to in ten minutes, though — all my morning classes are the STEM ones, so in effect, I start every day with some electrical math things & then it turns itself around pretty quickly. Next semester will either hit like a truck or be the most refreshing thing I've ever felt — I can't wait to find out which.

Spring break is half a week closer, and with the weather still so nice I'm really hoping to bring my bicycle back to campus from home (maybe even ride it around while I'm at home). Spring is springing — usually it needs a little bit of help around this time of year and/or acts like my electric kettle has been as of late & heating the water up a little, then letting it cool back down and then actually bringing it up to temperature (maybe I should buy a new kettle, each heating cycle is progressively longer than the last).

So, at the end of the day, things are going. The university career fair is exactly a week from today, which is exciting and stressful (as all exciting things are) — I'd love to have an internship lined up for the fall right now (especially before I go home for a week to regenerate brain cells — I want to have one less thing keeping me up at night).

At the beginning of the day, though (now), I need to get to class, so I'm going to end this here for now.

Hopefully you appreciate the better thumbnail photo.

I'll be back!
