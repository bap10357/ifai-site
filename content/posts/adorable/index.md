这是真的中国菜。

<!--more-->

I thought the explanation for lack of cheese in Chinese food was that most Chinese were genetically lactose intolerant. Then the power of this creation is unleashed on humanity and spits in the face of all my preconceived notions.

I haven't tried it yet, but I will. I found a store earlier this evening that stocks a lot of imported goods (mostly from China & Japan) and it was a gold mine of quality content like this. There was also a good-looking "_chicken meat floss seaweed toast bread_" that I might have to come back to buy soon.

There's nothing more to what I have to say today — just, a PSA: you never know what you might find when you look for random things. I was with some friends who were trying to find Pokemon cards.

You might strike gold. Cheese gold. Powdered cheese gold in an imported bottled latte.

A new morning ritual for you, right there.

拜拜大家。
