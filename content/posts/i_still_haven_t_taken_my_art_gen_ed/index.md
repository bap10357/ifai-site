But that hasn’t stopped me from expressing myself with the power of, err, machine-generated watercolor effects over the top of neat pictures that I took in order to make them look more *dreamlike* and *magical* and like I’m even somewhat skilled in the graphic arts!

Actually, I used the iOS app “Waterlogue” for these, and it’s still up on the App Store (although I think it’s on the older side, I’m not sure how many updates it still gets). You can just feed in pictures and then they’ll come out stylized. You can choose a number of different filters ranging from technical drawings to old portraits, but the watercolor one is the default for a reason.

They look good, I think! The train one should look familiar, but it was a good take and looks even better in wishy-washy hand paints.
