As in, halfway through the semester. Feels like progress.

I didn't have any good pictures to put as the thumbnail here, but this train photo spoke to me when I was browsing the pictures of the day of this month on Wikimedia Commons. Plus, it's from the homeland to which I'm so patriotic.

I feel like I did my job resting properly over break, because I've had a good morning so far. I'm writing this post now waiting for access to the practice room that I booked, which will be highly necessary considering that in orchestra we've got a concert on Wednesday and the last impression of a progress report that we got from the professor was "we're still very far from ready".

I did practice plenty over break, so I feel like I also did my job in that regard. I'm having a lot more fun with music programs now than I ever have before, but I feel like this'll be my last semester doing too much of this before I decide I make a better audience member.

Elsewhere on the to-do list are an exam that I've got on Wednesday morning — for which I feel surprisingly okay on the content right now, and feel like it was definitely a good call on that professor's part to put it right after break — and waiting two more months before the one-week trip to Taipei that I'm so excited for. Yesterday, I was browsing around Zhongzheng district on Google Street View trying to find neat landmarks to visit to fill the two days off that I'll have during that week, and I discovered the [Museum of Drinking Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Drinking_Water). I think this and a trip to 228 Peace Memorial Park would make for a good few hours that I can handle on foot alone.

Besides that, I underwent a little bit of a caffeine detox over the past few days & then, this morning, I bought a latte, so I'm feeling a little bit jittery. I should definitely invest in becoming a tea person.

But otherwise, I'm still rolling forward. Like the train. So things are good.
