If you read yesterday's post, looked at the screenshot of that room layout I posted and thought that you could make some improvements, you were right.

Maybe it was only bothering me, but I put this room together pretty quickly and I wasn't paying that much attention. I looked back at the picture a few times and wanted to make the room look like it should.

So there we go. This is nicer.
