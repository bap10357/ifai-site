I was reading yesterday's post and I just couldn't help but make a few corrections and additions.

<!--more-->

I'll be concise, but I said a few things that were clearly wrong:

 1. Rochester isn't "like Toronto, but worse", it's "like Toronto, but better".

 2. My Bb clarinet can play most of these runs just fine, just not one of the trills.

 3. I'm not _terrible_ at Mandarin, I'm _passable_. I think.

This post is definitely sleep-deprivation induced, but I haven't had a good night of rest in quite a while because I've just been moving a little fast.

I've been organizing a little, then organizing a lot, I've been trying to grow my confidence and get a little more in order than it's been in the past. I've been mostly successful, but I think the most important thing for me to know is that if I move too quickly, I tire myself out.

My resolution for the month of April is to feel better, move slower, get better sleep, and to stop trying to track my progress so hard that it gets in the way of my learning.

No matter what context you're in, I feel like that's a good thing to remember. At least, it is for me.

再見！
