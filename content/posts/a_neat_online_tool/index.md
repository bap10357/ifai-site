大家好！

This has nothing to do with anything, and everything to do with my off-hours Mandarin studying strategies. I was looking around the internet last night and I found a neat tool, which also has an offline version. It’s a Chinese-English dictionary—I used to use the Yabla one until it went down earlier this week—this one has a little bit of additional information, too, like HSK levels. I’m not sure how the vocabulary from one to the other compares, but this one also has an offline version; on Mac, this is a dictionary that you can add to the “Dictionary” application, which makes it pretty clean and elegant and match with the rest of the user interface.

這是我找到的中文詞典：

我希望你們喜歡，我已經能看這個詞典很好用。

If this is useful to you, I recommend you check it out! The full version is $15.95, which isn’t terrible, even if it’s just a dictionary. A paper dictionary would probably cost more than that, and this one is nice to keep around.

It can even do personal names of a few famous people (just see the thumbnail photo).

再見！
