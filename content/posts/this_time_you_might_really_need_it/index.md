I know this is a time for a lot of people in the US that keep up with any amount of political news. I walked around today, and all day, nobody said anything. That’s probably a good thing. I shouldn’t care so much about government, but you know, I have to live in a place with a single figurehead all the way in the front, so I guess it’s natural to care who that person is.

Whether you’re happy or disappointed, it’s always a good time to add another track to your (existent or not) orchestral/wind ensemble music library, and this time, it’s even a little different! I bought a Switch a while ago, and since I had Switch Online, I got a notification about it when that new “Nintendo Music” app came around. Being someone born in the mid-2000s who has the obligatory fondness for Nintendo games and their music, I thought I’d try it out. Plus, the Kirby Star Allies soundtrack is on there, and that’s already a killer app for me (not that I’ve ever played anything more than just the demo for the actual game).

Anyway, my uninformed, but still interested, musical mind stumbled across the fact that Pikmin music’s instrumentation is usually all orchestra (I just haven’t played too many Pikmin games, I guess). Pikmin 4’s definitely going the “relaxing & cute” way of many Nintendo games in the past few years, and it’s entirely welcome. In the list of top tracks from Pikmin 4 — a game that listening to the soundtrack to might lead me to eventually buy despite never having considered myself a Pikmin fan — was the closing-credits theme, which is just 漂亮得不得了!

You see, I’m getting this week’s grammar practice in, too.

Anyway, it’s just incredible. And, it’s in a really slow 3/4, but it isn’t super “waltz-ish”. I don’t know much about music theory, but I think that the effect is cool.

If you need music to sit out, stare into the sunset, and eat baby carrots to while watching a colony of ants lift a breadcrumb down a wall to some tiny anthill in the grass, this is it.

I hope “Nintendo Music” doesn’t get these YouTube channels taken down, because this is truly a public service.

Enjoy!
