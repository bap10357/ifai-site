I often mention in blog posts that I feel a little bad that this blog is always a one-way conversation.

<!--more-->

I wanted to see if I could make this site a little bit more interactive — other than my guestbook, which you can leave a note in if you want! — so recently, I had the idea to integrate a survey in to see what people were thinking.

I wanted to find a decent anonymous survey platform that didn't cost money, and I found [freesurveys.org](https://freesurveys.org/), which seems to be good enough. If someone else knows of a nicer survey platform for me to use and this survey is relatively successful, leave a note in the guestbook and I'll try to use an even better platform next time.

If you've had any burning feedback to give, this is your opportunity! You can fill out the form from the iframe above, or I'll also give a link that brings you to the full survey page.

You can access the survey [here](https://freesurveys.org/s/otY8DtfFUe).

All of the results and the survey itself are wiped 90 days after creation, so on September 19 of this year, the survey will no longer be accessible. I'll put this post on the navbar at the top of the site so that people can continue to access it even after it gets buried in other posts.

I'll remove the link from the navbar in 90 days and update this post with whatever information is relevant after the end of the three survey months.

Let's hope this experiment gets results!

Thank you for the reads (and, hopefully, for the feedback).

I'll be posting again soon, as always.
