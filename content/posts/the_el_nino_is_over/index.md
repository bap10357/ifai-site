…and I’m ready for the winter.

<!--more-->

I’m really ready for this semester to be over. I’m not sure if, for the past few weeks, I’ve been sustaining myself on only the hope of going home for Thanksgiving, but I did that and it felt good. Then I came back. Now I’m tired again.

So, finals week starts now, we had some nice winter weather a while ago (and it’s all melted away now because we’re in a little bit of a “warm” wave) but it at least had me appreciating nature. (Update: it’s Thursday and the snow’s back. All morning, the weather outside has definitely been delightfully frightful. Nice!)

The other season that ’tis for is for fun orchestral music (which ’tis always the season for) and a nice place to experience some of that is right [here at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRheWLMYfnQ). There’s a playlist with these recordings in it, but I wanted to start it halfway through and couldn’t get the link to do that reliably.

My favorites are Danse Macabre (at the link), the John Williams one, and the Petite Suite (my new favorite piece of music, I think, ever written). I am also a little biased toward the clarinet line toward the end of the harp section in Danse Macabre for no reason in particular.

And then, I’m not sure how the Williams recording came out so well, but it did, and it goes hard (especially at 110 percent speed!).

So, to the tune of the “dance of death”, I’m going to go make an attempt at being prepared for my circuits and statistics finals, which are back-to-back tomorrow at the earliest two time slots. Truly, this is the soundtrack to my life.

Just one more week!
