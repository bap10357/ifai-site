This is my blog — like most other personal blogs, it's like a Facebook page, but wordier.

I'm an undergrad university student studying microelectronics and "Applied Chinese Language and Culture" — my school's term for "Chinese language, but it's a bachelor's of science" — in Rochester, New York.

Nothing about my life is, maybe, interesting, but that's not for me to judge. In any case, whenever I lose too much sleep I come here to talk out my overactive brain, which is an underrated benefit of having a blog that people can't comment on — much better than the assumed judgment of social media.

The top-right corner button will take you to the Mandarin version of the blog, where I get my language practice — those posts have different content, and if you want, you can check it out.

I'll always have a consistent schedule posting here because I do love blogging!

Thanks for the visit — please enjoy the posts.

See you!
