features:
  - title: "Readable problem summaries"
    description: "SmartPCB AI generates reports based on information from its simulations, which it compiles into readable natural language summarizing the most important details of problems encountered during the verification stage."
  - title: "Deep and detailed reports"
    description: "Data from multiple simulation sources is combined in order to cover the entire spectrum of potential problems found in verification. Data can be distributed in automatically-generated reports to clients and other teams based on the information that they need, when they need it."
  - title: "Viewable issue maps"
    description: "Heatmaps of problems like signal interference and power quality can be used to produce a visual reassurance that the product is ready for production before the schematic is sent to the manufacturer."
  - title: "Integration with simulation"
    description: "Integrations with industry-standard simulation software allows for familiar, fast, and reliable testing without manual data summary or entry. Moving simulation results from software to report is only a press of a button."
