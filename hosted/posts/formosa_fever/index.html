<p>So, this is it. The first day of the rest of my life!</p>
<p>Just kidding. I have to leave in eight days. So sad.</p>
<p>Iâve had a pretty excellent time in the one day since the plane landed (actually, less than that â I didnât get too much sleep last night and exchanged it for a nice first day full of doing things).</p>
<p>I havenât had a haircut in a long time, and the humidity is too much for any poor weak American hair product I mightâve packed to be able to handle, so my hairstyleâs already changed. One step toward evolving into my final form of world traveler with zero insecurity.</p>
<p>This isnât exactly a Taipei city review â thatâs something I can do later if I get the opportunity and have the desire â and most of the travel I did today was in New Taipei City / Xinbei anyway, so I havenât really seen all that life in the great capital has to offer.</p>
<p>The first thing that I did today was go to éæ­è±æ¼¿ Fuhang Soy Milk, which I had never heard of but realized their status when I found that Seven-Eleven apparently sells and brands their flagship product. Seems like I was the only one who had never heard of it!</p>
<p>As was to be expected, they were running a very efficient business. The person sitting across from me was a vlogger, which was an interesting thing to see. She had a microphone out and a camera pointed at the food and was making a YouTube video right there in front of me.</p>
<p>Not that Iâm any better, because I took a picture, too:</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/formosa_fever/fuhang.png" alt="Seed bread and bean juice.">
  <figcaption>Seed bread and bean juice.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was excellent, Iâm not going to lie. Itâs the only soy milk restaurant / Taiwanese breakfast joint that Iâve ever seen, so I didnât have a benchmark in mind, but it was definitely better than any fast-food breakfast Iâve had in the US, and it was only $85 NT (a friend gave me the bit of the æ²¹æ¢ for free).</p>
<p>After that, I went back to the hotel room and made myself a cup of coffee using the complimentary kettle, which got really hot near the wall jack that had the loose connection and certainly didnât fill me with confidence. It hasnât started a fire yet, and itâs not too late to alert the hotel staff whoâre at the front desk about three steps from my hotel room doorâ¦</p>
<p>æ²äºå§ã</p>
<p>One of my professors and our tour group went together on a tour that the professor had scheduled, so in the morning we went to the éæ³å°è³ªå¬å Yehliu Geography Park, which I had never heard of. I didnât take the obligatory photo of the queenâs head rock formation because we got that as a group, but I got some nice landscapes:</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/formosa_fever/yehliu_rocks.png" alt="A great wallpaper.">
  <figcaption>A great wallpaper.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This was just to the left of the å¥³çé ­. It didnât have a tourist path right behind it, so I was able to get a legitimately nice-looking photo (the path in the background adds some interest, anyway). This looks like a macOS wallpaper! I expect some Taiwanese beauty in the Apple stock collection soon.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/formosa_fever/yehliu_pool.png" alt="A really nice looking photo in today's weather.">

<p>I felt the desperate urge to take this photo after standing outside in the 90 percent humidity for over an hour. Itâs a wonder nobody was trying to swim in thereâ¦</p>
<p>Really, I got used to it after a while, anyway â it isnât as bad as somebody who likes to complain would have you believe.</p>
<p>We popped back on to the National Highway No. 1 afterward to get some views in at ä¹ä»½ Jiufen, which was a nice turn to the other end of the oceanfront-wetness-to-mountain-breeze spectrum. It seems like I wasnât the only one who felt that way:</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/formosa_fever/jiufen_cats.png" alt="Like the MRT mascot, but in real life.">
  <figcaption>Like the MRT mascot, but in real life.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We got lunch there, and there was this neat bird sitting to my right on a pole in front of a pretty excellent mountain view.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/formosa_fever/jiufen_bird.png" alt="I don't know what kind of bird this is.">
  <figcaption>I don't know what kind of bird this is.</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of these landscapes are made even more beautiful by the humidity so intense that itâs visible â that&rsquo;s just the Formosa fog. Apparently, everyone here lives inside a Playstation 1.</p>
<p>We shopped around at stores for a little bit, and then left to å¹³æºª Pingxi to do the same thing. The center shopping road has train tracks running through the middle, and after messing around with writing on a fire balloon for a while, taking some pictures with it, and then launching it, the train actually came â I hadnât been expecting that, so it was funny when the person helping us with the fire balloon started wildly waving her hand away from the tracks right after we launched it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we avoided the rain the whole time we were outside, and it picked up on the way back to Taipei. I think itâs up now, but when I first walked back in to my hotel room I was prepared with my raincoat and the shoulder-strap bag that I had bought at one of the stores covered in the characters of my favorite writing system. Clearly, the people here have excellent taste in both graphic design and phonetics.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/formosa_fever/bopomofo_bag.png" alt="I could be a model in that outfit.">
  <figcaption>I could be a model in that outfit.</figcaption></figure>
<p>My group partners for the project that brought me here in the first place told me raincoats werenât stylish, but theyâll have to reconsider when they see me in this.</p>
<p>I might need to lay down and prepare for that job interview I still havenât finished the recording for before we go to eat out tonight. Being that weâre staying on ä¿¡ç¾©è·¯ Xinyi Rd, thatâs at é¼æ³°è± Din Tai Fung (Ding Tai Feng).</p>
<p>It may also be a while before I really come back with a lot more content to share, because I anticipate being pretty busy â thatâll be good because Iâll spend a lot of time collecting neat info and not blogging, and Iâll come back in about a week with a big blog post to share. Now might really be the time to become an Internet city reviewer!</p>
