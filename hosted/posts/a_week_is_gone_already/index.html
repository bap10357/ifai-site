  <figcaption>How the words come out.</figcaption></figure>
<p>One week&rsquo;s passed already since my last post.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like just finding another nice landscape that someone else took and making it the thumbnail image — I do that pretty frequently. I didn&rsquo;t have any good pictures lying around in my phone&rsquo;s photo library, so I thought I should just find something around me to take a picture of. Without getting out of my seat, I decided to share the view on my end. It&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>First of all, this week was very, very dry and cold &amp; some of the heaters in the classrooms were broken — it was still better than outside — but if anyone knows anything about meteorology, it&rsquo;s probably that cold fronts get followed by warm fronts. I forgot about that, and so at least my conversation about the weather can turn positive — it&rsquo;s really beautiful today. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s above freezing, but it basically feels like springtime compared to Monday and Tuesday. 挺好！</p>
<p>Second, the things that were going to happen this week all went pretty well — housing selection is this coming week, I managed to (at least, so far) get my way into a 中文 double major (但是我還要等一個學期當“真的”中文專業） and, amid my excitement, am getting a little more rigorous about my class planning for future semesters. I think I have it all worked out, but you don&rsquo;t know for sure until course selection time comes.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t have an internship, which I&rsquo;ll need to graduate, especially if I want to use one of my free semesters to study abroad (which, right now, is the plan). I&rsquo;m revisiting my plan to potentially try to become a lab assistant for one of my professors, which I really think would be the best possible outcome. I think most of his research is in thin films, and I haven&rsquo;t taken the mandatory &ldquo;thin films&rdquo; class yet, but I think he knows I can learn and that I try.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ve been doing for the past few days is attempting to cut out caffeine, which (my old hot brown of choice was coffee, but that&rsquo;s pretty highly concentrated) has now resulted in my compromising with myself by way of discovering that tea is pretty good, too. I mean, whatever works — I think tea is cheaper anyway, so it&rsquo;s at least better for my wallet.</p>
<p>So, all in all, pretty excellent week. I thought I had a fever yesterday because I was cold everywhere I went, but I think I just needed sleep (was lacking energy &amp; didn&rsquo;t bring my winter coat to campus). It was also pretty windy yesterday. I got some sleep &amp; I feel pretty great now. Again, it always works and never ceases to amaze me. It&rsquo;s almost like humans were built to survive on a regular sleep schedule — I wonder if anyone else has ever figured this out before?</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future — I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about my plans for studying abroad now. I mean, I think there are clearly smart and clearly dumb ways to go about this, so with my years of opportunity to plan (two, since I told the head of the Chinese major program that I planned to study abroad spring 2027), I should really focus on doing a good job. I have to go through the college application process again, more-or-less, but under a slightly different context. Things to not mess up include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting proper scholarship funding</li>
<li>Finding a program that&rsquo;s priced reasonably to begin with</li>
<li>Finding a good program with a good course selection</li>
<li>Finding a program in a place that I really want to be (probably Taipei)</li>
<li>Having the proper courses done already before I go (this is one of the reasons why I need to wait — two classes I should&rsquo;ve taken this year weren&rsquo;t offered)</li>
<li>Getting a program that occurs during the time frame I want to go (optimally spring of two years from now)</li>
<li>Talking to people who&rsquo;ve already done a program of this type so that I can stay informed</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one should actually be achievable, since I was — in my first email CC&rsquo;ed to me as a prospective Chinese major — told about a session that might be held sometime in the coming month which is for this exact purpose — getting study-abroad students to talk about their experiences. I really need this, so that&rsquo;s pretty exciting too.</p>
<p>This is all very exciting, overall. My mom always told me, when I was first looking for and entering college, that as the course material gets harder, it&rsquo;ll get more fun at the same time if I choose something that I&rsquo;m really interested in and really want to learn. I wasn&rsquo;t exactly seeing that and, in my attempts to find a good compromise between a useful degree in a growing industry and a fun one where I get to learn about history and culture and be a liberal arts student, I set the end-goal in my head as double-majoring in Mandarin, thinking that it&rsquo;d be pretty unachievable.</p>
<p>The fact that I&rsquo;m working through this now makes me sleep way easier at night. First world problems, I know — still, it&rsquo;s really cool. Hopefully my dreams don&rsquo;t come crashing down with course conflicts — I talked to the Chinese major program head about this, too, and it seems like we&rsquo;ve constructed a pretty resilient roadmap for me. If I can get my internship blocks filled and I have the opportunity to study abroad spring 2027, I can take the required &ldquo;Professional/Business Chinese&rdquo; class for getting the major while I&rsquo;m doing that, instead of having to take it here. That&rsquo;ll make my life a little easier. That, and since I&rsquo;m completing the final prerequisite for the rest of the Chinese classes in the program right now — Intermediate II — I&rsquo;ll be able to take whatever classes I want in the future. If one of the lower-level classes doesn&rsquo;t align with my schedule, I can just skip ahead &amp; take the science and technology Chinese course or something like that. I have some flexibility. Let&rsquo;s hope it stays that way.</p>
<p>So, hopefully my prospects stay good &amp; the weather stays equally nice.</p>
<p>Spring break is in a few weeks — once that comes, it&rsquo;ll probably feel great to go back home, as long as the way that I have to do that — the car — stays in good shape with the battery &amp; everything (I mean, I haven&rsquo;t touched it in several weeks and it was complaining about a low charge back then. I should probably start it up &amp; fill it with gas &amp; drive it somewhere to make sure it&rsquo;s still okay).</p>
<p>Spring! 春天！ A good season.</p>
<p>We could probably all use it right now.</p>
<p>謝謝光臨。</p>
<p>下個星期見！</p>
